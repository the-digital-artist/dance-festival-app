Massage therapy is a powerful support for easing stress, relieving aches and pains, and establishing a new relationship to touch. From chronic pain to acute injuries, I have helped many of my clients find new neural and physical pathways to feeling better through manual therapy and brainstorming shifting daily habits that may be causing recurring pain.
