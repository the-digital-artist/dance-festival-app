      "bio": "13 years ago, I walked into my first yoga studio with excruciating back pain and a desperate need for change. I was nervous about finding the right studio because I didn't fit the \"typical yoga image.\" But I stumbled upon a new studio in town and was welcomed with open arms into a loving and supportive community. This experience transformed me, and I finally felt like I was stepping into my truest form.\n\nDuring my yoga teacher training, I discovered my passion for creating a diverse and welcoming community. As a Latina (first generation Salvadoran), I often felt like I didn't belong in the wellness world, and I knew that I wanted to change that by giving everyone a space to practice as they are. With continued studies and the development of my own healing rituals, I created MYSTIC WELLNESS - a transformative space that is designed to revitalize you, no matter your background.\n\nMy teachings of sound meditation, Kundalini Yoga, and plant medicine guidance are all-inclusive, led from the heart, and infused with fun. Let me help you find your inner mystic and embark on a journey of finding your essence.",

      "bio": "My philosophy and intention in all of my services (coaching, consulting, speaking, facilitating workshops) is that wellness must be embodied in order for it to be truly sustainable. Because our lived experience resides in our bodies, true transformation happens when we move from knowledge to embodying this knowledge in our daily habits and practices. This is why in all of my offerings I seek to get to the source of the issue, (especially in regards to burnout) and always include somatic (physical) practices to promote lasting change. Wellness is more than treating a symptom, it’s really about empowering oneself to live a life filled with more options, and that happens when capacity is available. \n\nI base my services from information received in trainings, on data from neuroscience, corporate surveys and the feedback from those who have experienced burnout due to systemic issues. This is often overlooked as a source of burnout and yet significantly contributes to the high levels of stress and anxiety that historically marginalized people experience. Constantly navigating “mirco” aggressions, assumptions and equity issues, to name a few, all have a direct impact on the nervous system.\n\nI am an avid learner and have attended over a thousand hours of training in various wellness modalities which have informed my own healing process. Here are some examples: burnout recovery and the nervous system, somatic release for stress and anxiety, trauma informed coaching, 500 hours of yoga certification, the neuroscience of healing, healing race-based trauma, meditation and mindfulness and nutrition.I have experienced all of practices and techniques offered in my coaching program and workshops, and I can confidently recommend these to my clients. I healed - now I help others heal. \n\nIn my signature coaching system of supporting women of color in their wellness goals, I include accountability (for support), creativity (to consistently challenge perspectives) and mindset (what we think literally creates our reality).  Because I love to nerd out on the brain, I always include some type of neuroscience as relevant data to support the healing process.\n\nI am naturally creative and curious, and I love being in community! It’s my joy to help women of color find their wings and empower them to soar in their wellness and resilience!",

      "bio": "Here is a piece I wrote for Zen Center’s 50th anniversary Windbell in 2012, which tells one version of my story:\n\nI did not intend to study Buddhism, nor did I have the sense that I was drawn to it by my own suffering. My aim in life, from the onset of adolescence, was to try to live authentically, however that might mean. From the time I left college until I was thirty-five, I lived in London, with, eventually, a steady and rewarding career at the BBC, a nice apartment, a jazz band, a warm circle of friends and a wide range of cultural activities. Yet I always sensed there was more to come. From my particular karmic roots, some of whose proximate causes I knew then, I thought it had to do with love.\n\nI came to Zen Center having met someone who lived there. I was curious to know what part zen training played in making this person who they were. I knew some Buddhists in London, mostly practising in the Tibetan tradition, and had appreciated them as good people, saying to myself that I should investigate this one day, in the way that I also did about voice training, or salsa dancing. When the opportunity came to move to San Francisco, it seemed natural to take it.\n\nI don’t know why I found it fit my life so well. I didn’t especially enjoy zazen, but willingly followed the schedule. Two years at City Center were followed by two years of Tassajara, learning to get used to being cold, tired and hungry much of the time, and to having precious little unscheduled time where I could do what I wanted. But I loved it, and when I left, all I could think of was coming back. It took me two years, and a huge upheaval – since karma has a way of coming to trip you up – but I had the firm sense that being a priest was what I wanted to do with my life, and I couldn’t think of a better place to pursue that path.\n\nI feel very lucky to have been able to practice at Zen Center, where it is possible to follow something like traditional monastic training for many years, a deep learning that I hope will launch me on a teaching career in due time. I can’t say exactly why I want to teach, but I feel strongly that this is a way of living that presents great possibilities of peace and joy, and I want others to have the chance to experience this for themselves.  In the last year, I have been helping to run the new Young Urban Zen group, which has been an amazingly rewarding opportunity to put this desire into practice and to see the benefits of sharing the teachings.\n\nI take great comfort in knowing that there is no end to practice, no exam to pass, no time when you can consider yourself finished, but that you can keep the practice alive for as long as you stay committed to it. Although I have a different idea now of how it manifests in the world, I still think it has to do with love.",

It’s also a life goal of mine to open an eating disorder treatment center specifically for the BIPOC community. One of my ultimate goals in life is to cultivate and create spaces where BIPOC and fat bodies are welcome without judgement. My love of moving my body, working with children and being a therapist is what drives me. TendWell is an opportunity for me to work with individuals who are grounded in their values and accept me as I am with what I have to offer the world.",
